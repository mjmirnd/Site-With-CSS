    <b>Elden Ring is an action role-playing game played in a third person perspective</b>, with gameplay focusing on combat and exploration; it features elements similar to those found in other games developed by FromSoftware, such as the Dark Souls
    series, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Set in an open world, players are allowed to freely explore the Lands Between and its six main areas; These locations range from Limgrave, an area featuring grassy plains and ancient ruins, to
    Caelid, a wasteland home to undead monsters.[1] Open world areas are explorable using the character's mount, Torrent, as the primary mode of transportation, along with the ability to fast travel outside of combat. Throughout the game, players
    encounter non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies alike, including the demigods who rule each main area and serve as the game's main bosses.[2][3] Aside from open world areas, Elden Ring also features hidden dungeons, such as catacombs, tunnels,
    and caves where players can fight bosses and gather helpful items.[4]

  <p> The player chooses a character class at the start of the game, which determines the spells and equipment that they start out with.[5] Combat with enemies can be within melee range, or from a distance using ranged weapons or spells. Attacks from
    enemies can be blocked using shields or avoided by dodging. Spells in Elden Ring allow the player to enhance their own weapons, fight enemies from afar, or restore lost hit points.
    The player can memorize a limited amount of spells, which can be cast using a staff or Sacred Seal item.[6][7]
    Weapons in Elden Ring can be improved using Ashes of War, obtainable items that grant weapons new capabilities.
    Ashes of War can be applied to or removed from weapons, and each Ash adds a Weapon Art, a special ability that can be used during combat.[8]
    Aside from direct combat, stealth mechanics can be used to avoid enemies entirely, or allow for the targeting of foes with critical hits while hidden.</p>

  <h2>Plot </h2>

  <p>
    Early on in their journey to repair the Elden Ring, the Tarnished encounters a Maiden named Melina.
    As the Tarnished is Maidenless, Melina offers to act as their Maiden, granting them the ability to turn runes into strength, as well as giving the Tarnished her steed Torrent. She does this under the condition that the Tarnished brings her to the
    Erdtree, the home of the Elden Ring. Melina later takes the Tarnished to the Roundtable Hold, a gathering place for other Tarnished seeking to repair the Elden Ring. The Tarnished is instructed by the Hold's benefactor, the Two Fingers, to
    collect the Great Runes and bring them to the Erdtree, where they can be used to repair the Elden Ring.</p>
</div>



<center><img class="class1" src="images/plot.jpg" alt="Elden Image" width="800" length="800"></center>

<div class="intro">

  <p>The <i>Tarnished</i> proceeds to journey into the Lands Between, investigating its various locales and defeating the demigods. The Tarnished soon recovers enough Great Runes so that the Two Fingers allows them to battle Morgott the Grace-Given,
    the demigod guarding the Erdtree. As he dies, Morgott claims that the Erdtree will not allow anyone to enter it, making the Elden Ring irreparable. The Tarnished confirms this when they approach the Erdtree and find the interior blocked by a wall
    of thorns. Melina then arrives and advises that they journey to find the Flame of Ruin, which they can use to set the Erdtree on fire and burn away the thorns. The Tarnished is then free to journey towards the Flame of Ruin, or can search for a
    way to harness the equally powerful Frenzied Flame.
    Upon obtaining the Flame of Ruin, if the Tarnished did not gain the power of the Frenzied Flame, then Melina will take the Flame of Ruin and sacrifice herself to set the Erdtree on fire. If the Tarnished gained the power of the Frenzied Flame,
    then Melina will abandon the Tarnished, forcing them to use the Frenzied Flame to set the Erdtree on fire. Regardless, the Tarnished is transported to the ruined city of Farum Azula while the Erdtree burns. After defeating Maliketh the Black
    Blade and using his Rune of Death to fuel the fire, the Tarnished is returned to the foot of the scorched Erdtree.
    Inside, they fight the reanimated remains of Queen Marika's consort Radagon, as well as the guardian of the tree, the Elden Beast. After both are vanquished, the Tarnished gains access to Marika's shattered corpse, which contains the remains of
    the Elden Ring. Depending on the Tarnished's actions throughout the game, six different endings can then be achieved, ranging from the Tarnished becoming the Elden Lord, to allowing the Elden Ring to be destroyed by Ranni the Witch, or using the
    Frenzied Flame to destroy the Lands Between.</p>

      Premise
  </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    <strong>Elden Ring takes place in the Lands Between, a fictional landmass ruled over by several demigods</strong>. It was previously ruled over by the immortal Queen Marika, who acted as keeper of the Elden Ring, a powerful force that manifested
    as the physical concept of order.
    When Marika eventually shattered the Elden Ring and disappeared, her demigod children began warring over pieces of the Ring in an event called the Shattering.
    <em>Each demigod possesses a shard of the Ring called a Great Rune, which corrupts them with power.</em> In the game, the player character is a Tarnished, one of a group of exiles from the Lands Between who are summoned back after the Shattering.
    As one of the Tarnished, the player must traverse the realm to repair the Elden Ring and become the Elden Lord.
  </p>

  <p>Production of the game began in early 2017 following the release of The Ringed City, a piece of downloadable content for Dark Souls III. The game was developed alongside Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, which Miyazaki also directed. He explained that
    although the combat in Elden Ring has similarities to Sekiro, neither game directly inspired the mechanics of the other.[31][32] FromSoftware was able to develop both games simultaneously using a "co-director" structure, in which each of the
    developerâ€™s games had a staff member acting as director through its first stages of development. Miyazaki would then later provide direction on the game's mechanics, art, and music.[26]
    The design team of Elden Ring focused on environmental scale, roleplaying elements, and storytelling as the core elements of the game. Developers credited the scale of environments as responsible for creating a sense of diversity in the game and
    intended for the roleplaying elements to allow for a variety of player interactions with the environment. Increasing the scale of the game required the creation of a multitude of castles, caves, and dungeons that players explore. FromSoftware
    said the stealth and summoning systems were implemented in order to add alternatives to direct engagement in combat.[33] Miyazaki mentioned Shadow of the Colossus, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher 3, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild as
    design influences for Elden Ring. He also credited RuneQuest, The Lord of the Rings, and Michael Moorcock's novel The Eternal Champion as inspirations for the game's story.[34][35] Elden Ring's original soundtrack was composed by Tsukasa Saitoh,
    Shoi Miyazawa, Tai Tomisawa, Yuka Kitamura, and Yoshimi Kudo.[36]</p>

      Sales
  </h2>
  </center>
  <p>
    Elden Ring sold 13.4 million copies worldwide by the end of March 2022 and 16.6 million by the end of June 2022. It was the top-selling game in several regions between February and March 2022,[89][90] and is the fastest-selling Bandai Namco game
    of all time.
    The game's open world setting received acclaim, with reviewers praising the exploration mechanics. Tamoor Hussain of GamesSpot praised the Lands Between as the most expansive of FromSoftware's settings, calling exploration and discovery the main
    appeal of the game.[69] Mitchell Saltzman of IGN lauded the game for rewarding exploration on every part of the map.[70] Simon Parkin of The Guardian called the game's environments "intriguing and inventive."[71] Some reviewers liked that the
    open landscape provided opportunities to discover and try multiple challenges.[72][73] Exploration drew many favorable comparisons to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.[69][70][74] The environments of the game were also praised for their
    artistic designs, with reviewers positively rating their execution in an open setting, while also appreciating the designs of linear dungeons.[69][75][76]

    Similarly to FromSoftware's earlier Souls games, Elden Ring's difficulty provoked much commentary, with reviewers both praising and criticizing its lack of easier modes as discouraging towards new players.[77][78][79] Other reviewers considered
    Elden Ring the most accessible Souls game, saying that the player could choose to avoid difficult threats and return with more experience.[72][73][74] The combat of Elden Ring was praised for offering options towards fighting enemies, while
    keeping the game challenging.[73][75][80] Torrent and fast travel were well-received features, with reviewers citing them as large improvements towards making the game easier to explore.[72][73][76][81] The placing of checkpoints was also praised
    as helpful towards making the game more approachable.[66][80][82]
